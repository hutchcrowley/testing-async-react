## üßê About <a name = "about">Testing Async React.js</a>

Welcome! I created the project boilerplate for this application with create-react-app. The purpose of this repo is as a sort of sandbox for learning new testing techniques, particularly asynchronous testing with jest.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

- [install yarn] - MacOS - download homebrew **https://brew.sh/**. Once it is installed, to go a terminal window and type brew install yarn. This will install the yarn package manager, which you will need to install various dependencies. For this project, I have tried to keep ait fairly light on dependencies.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
